# 🍓 Raspberry Pi Labs

A collection of hands-on Raspberry Pi labs focusing on networking, DNS filtering (Pi-hole), secure remote access, file sharing, firewall hardening, and home-lab infrastructure.  
Each lab builds on previous ones to create a secure, functional, and scalable Raspberry Pi environment.
